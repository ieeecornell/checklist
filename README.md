# Graduation checklist tool

## Install the checklist tool

Requires Ruby and Rubygems.

Run `gem install bundler` then `bundle install`. That should get everything installed. This app uses Postgres as the DB.

## Deployment

The app is currently deployed in the free tier of Heroku but it should get moved to AWS, or wherever the main site is hosted, since that will be cheaper and will allow for more database rows probably.
